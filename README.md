💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Fraud detection is a critical application of AI, especially in the financial sector where millions of transactions occur every day. The main challenge in such datasets is class imbalance — fraudulent transactions are extremely rare compared to legitimate ones.

🚀 Project Overview
Built and trained in Google Colab using Python

Based on a real-world anonymized credit card transactions dataset

Tackles class imbalance using resampling techniques

Applies data preprocessing, scaling, and feature analysis

Trains and evaluates multiple ML models

📊 Dataset
The dataset contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. It includes:

284,807 transactions

492 fraudulent cases

Features are numerical and anonymized (V1 to V28), plus Amount, Time, and Class (fraud = 1)

🧠 ML Techniques Used
Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Decision Tree

X-Y Split Test

SMOTE for class balancing

Feature scaling (StandardScaler)

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

📈 Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

Precision: measures how many predicted frauds were correct

Recall: measures how many actual frauds were detected

F1-Score: balance between precision and recall

Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Google Colab

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Imbalanced-learn (for SMOTE)

📝 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can effectively identify fraudulent transactions from a highly imbalanced dataset. Further improvements can include deploying the model via Flask and integrating real-time APIs for alerts.
